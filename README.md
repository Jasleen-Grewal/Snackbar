# Snackbar
## Introduction:
Snackbar is considered as a UI(User Interface) element which we usually used for feedback of the user, especially when an instantaneous feedback is required from the user after the action is performed. Snackbar appears at the bottom of screen and if Coordinator Layout is used as its parent, it can be dispersed by swiping.

## History:
Snackbar was introduced in Android Systems in API# 22.2.0.
